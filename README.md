# FastLed-Configurator
Wepp App to make easier to use the FastLEd library

Done by DoHITB, first publish on 03/02/2018.

# How it works
It's basically a visual tool in which you may define a name, a output pin and a number of led.

Then, you can choose between using preset effects, o making you own custom flow using instants and events.

When done, simply press "Get Source" and your *.ino file will be downloaded. Just burn it into your board and enjoy


# What do yo need?
Well, you will need the Arduino IDE or similar, also FastLED library installed on it.

To using this web app, you don't even need Internet connection, as the page was concibed as a monolitic page, so you can just download it and use it offline!
